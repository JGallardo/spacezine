		Space Zine began as a physical publication called "space"—a curated collection of clippings, visuals, and found materials that I assembled to tell bigger stories through experimental layouts. Like many zines, it was about experimentation: how do you tell more with less? How do layouts become visual storytelling? These publications were meant for silent reflection and often prompted conversations between artists when we'd trade our work.

		I enjoyed zine shows and the community they fostered, but wasn't able to attend as much as I would have liked. This led me to look at alternatives like forums and online communities, where I noticed the vibrant conversations happening over Tumblr blogs and saw how blog design could capture that same curatorial spirit digitally. I took a web development class at West LA College, where I first learned with Dreamweaver, and eventually discovered WordPress, which let me focus on crafting themes without worrying about backend complexity. This drew me deeper into frontend engineering, where I found the same creative problem-solving and attention to visual detail that I'd developed as an artist.

		Space Zine maintains that experimental spirit in digital form. This site is my first experiment with Astro, using WordPress as a headless CMS—combining modern web technologies with familiar content management. Like trading zines with other artists, sharing how this site was built continues those conversations, now between artists and engineers exploring the intersection of design and code.
