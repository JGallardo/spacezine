## About

Space Zine demonstrates how to build a secure, modern blog architecture that eliminates the security vulnerabilities of traditional WordPress installations. By using WordPress as a headless CMS with local-only access, this project shows how to maintain the content management benefits of WordPress while completely removing it from production infrastructure.

This approach eliminates common WordPress security concerns:
- **No admin login endpoints** exposed to the internet
- **No plugin vulnerabilities** in production
- **No database attacks** possible on live site
- **No brute force attempts** on WordPress login
- **No server-side code** that can be exploited

The result is a lightning-fast, completely static site that's immune to the security breaches that plague traditional WordPress installations, while still providing content creators with a familiar editing experience.

## Features

- ✅ WordPress headless CMS integration via WPGraphQL
- ✅ Static site generation with Astro
- ✅ Automatic image downloading and optimization during build
- ✅ Masonry-style archive layout
- ✅ RSS feed support
- ✅ SEO-friendly with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data
- ✅ Responsive design with 4px grid system
- ✅ Self-contained deployments (no runtime WordPress dependency)

## WordPress Setup

This project requires a local WordPress installation with:

1. **WPGraphQL plugin** installed and activated
2. **WordPress running locally** (e.g., via Local by WPEngine)
3. **Posts with featured images** for the archive

### Environment Variables

Set your WordPress URL in your environment or update `src/lib/wordpress.js`:

```javascript
const WORDPRESS_URL = process.env.WORDPRESS_URL || 'http://spacezine.local';
```

## Build Process

This project uses a **static data approach** with two sync commands for optimal performance:

### Content Sync (When WordPress content changes)
```bash
npm run sync-data
```

- **Fetches content**: Downloads all WordPress posts, titles, dates, etc.
- **Creates static JSON**: Saves to `src/data/posts.json` for instant loading
- **One-time process**: Only run when WordPress content is updated
- **Requires WordPress**: Local WordPress must be running

### Image Sync (When WordPress images change)
```bash
npm run sync-images
```

- **Downloads images**: Fetches all WordPress images locally
- **WebP conversion**: Converts images to optimized WebP format
- **One-time process**: Only run when new images are uploaded
- **Requires WordPress**: Local WordPress must be running

### Site Build (Fast)
```bash
npm run build
```

- **Static generation**: Creates HTML files using cached data and images
- **WordPress independent**: Works without WordPress running
- **Fast execution**: No WordPress API calls or image processing
- **Production ready**: Generates deployable `dist/` folder

### Why dist/ is Committed

Unlike typical projects, the `dist/` folder is committed to git because:

- **Security**: No WordPress installation needed on production or build servers
- **WordPress Independence**: Eliminates need for WordPress during deployment
- **Image Assets**: Contains downloaded WordPress images that can't be rebuilt without local WordPress access
- **Build Efficiency**: Skips build process on Netlify, reducing deployment time
- **Minimal Edits Use Case**: Perfect for sites with infrequent content updates

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project:

| Command | Action |
|:--------|:-------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `npm run sync-data` | **Sync WordPress content** - fetches posts, titles, dates to static JSON |
| `npm run sync-images` | **Sync WordPress images** - downloads and converts to WebP |
| `npm run build` | Build site using cached data and images (fast, WordPress not required) |
| `npm run preview` | Preview built site locally |

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development
1. **Development**: `npm run dev` for live development
2. **WordPress not required**: Site runs from cached static data and images

### Content Updates (When WordPress changes)
1. **Start WordPress**: Ensure your local WordPress site is running  
2. **Sync content**: `npm run sync-data` when posts/titles/dates change
3. **Sync images**: `npm run sync-images` when new images are uploaded
4. **Build site**: `npm run build` to generate updated static files
5. **Commit changes**: Add new data/images and updated dist/ files to git
6. **Deploy**: Push to trigger automatic Netlify deployment

### Typical Development Session
```bash
# Regular development (no WordPress needed)
npm run dev

# When you edit WordPress content (posts, titles, dates)
npm run sync-data    # Fetches latest content to static JSON

# When you upload new WordPress images  
npm run sync-images  # Downloads and converts new images

# Generate updated site
npm run build        # Fast build using cached data and images
git add -A           # Stage new content/images and dist updates  
git commit -m "Content update with latest posts"
git push             # Deploy to Netlify
```

## WordPress-Free Operation

After building, you can:
- Turn off WordPress for regular development
- Deploy the site without any WordPress dependency
- Only start WordPress when you need to rebuild with content changes

## Security & Deployment Model

This project uses a **"build locally, deploy statically"** approach that's ideal for:

- **High-security environments**: No server-side code or databases in production
- **Low-maintenance sites**: Content updates are infrequent and controlled
- **WordPress isolation**: Keep WordPress completely separate from public infrastructure
- **Version control**: All content changes are tracked in git via the committed `dist/` folder

### Netlify Deployment Process

The site deploys automatically via Netlify's git integration:

1. **Sync Content**: Run `npm run sync-data` when WordPress content changes
2. **Sync Images**: Run `npm run sync-images` when WordPress images change
3. **Build Site**: Run `npm run build` using cached data and images  
4. **Commit & Push**: Commit new data/images and updated `dist/` folder to your main branch
5. **Netlify Detection**: Netlify detects the git push via webhook
6. **Automatic Deployment**: Netlify skips the build process and deploys the committed `dist/` folder directly

> **Key Advantage**: No WordPress dependency during deployment - content and images are pre-processed and committed to git

#### Netlify Configuration

In your Netlify dashboard:

- **Build Command**: Leave empty (uses committed `dist/` folder)
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Branch**: `main` (or your default branch)
- **Deploy Context**: Production deploys automatically from main branch

The `netlify.toml` file tells Netlify to use the pre-built files:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "echo 'Using pre-built dist folder'"
```

This approach means:
- No build environment needed on Netlify
- No WordPress credentials or access required in production
- Faster deployments (just file copying, no build process)
- Complete isolation between content management and public site

## Design System

The project follows a **4px grid system**:
- All spacing uses multiples of 4px (4px, 8px, 16px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Major padding values: 16px, 32px, 64px
- Consistent visual rhythm throughout the site
